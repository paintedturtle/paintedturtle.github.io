This is the 50 watt variant of Yorkville‚Äôs Acoustic Master series of amplifiers.

It is designed to be the perfect combo for acoustic guitar and voice but its also practical as a keyboard amp or even a tiny PA system. This unit is in very good aesthetic and working condition.

The amplifier can sit upright like typical amp, projecting sound forward. Or it can sit back at angle to project sound upwards away from the floor which is often very handy acoustic arrangement. The sealed cabinet is constructed from plywood and covered with rugged carpet.

Channel 1 accepts a 1/4 inch cable from your acoustic-electric guitar or another electric instrument. The Pre-Amp control can accommodate guitars with active and passive pickups. The signal is routes through a two-band EQ (low and high) and then a sweepable notch filter to help reduce unwanted feedback.

Channel 2 accepts a balanced or unbalanced 1/4inch TRS cable or a balanced XLR cable from a microphone, or a mixer, or another source. This channel only has a Pre-Amp Gain control.

A very nice sounding spring reverb is applied to both channels with a single control to mix in the effect.

Both inputs are equipped with Clip indicator lights and there is 1/4 inch line output on front control panel to route audio to another device.

50 watts of output power into an 8 inch driver and a 3¬æ inch LeSon tweeter.

12 inches wide, 17 inches tall, 14 inches deep ‚Äì a very compact and conveniently sized amplifier. Not too heavy ‚Äì only 23 pounds ‚Äì and even includes velcro ties to keep the cord packed away.

<a href="mailto:instruments@paintedturtle.xyz">Send us a note</a> if you have any questions about this amplifier, or if you would like to arrange a time to check it out. We have a microphone and an electric piano that you can use to test the amplifier. However, we don‚Äôt have an acoustic-electric guitar on hand so you may want to bring your own if plan to pair it with this amplifier.

We are located in Little Italy a few blocks from the corner of Preston &amp; Somerset. Usually we are available on weekday afternoons and evenings ‚Äî just let us know what might work best for you and we‚Äôll get back to you soon.
