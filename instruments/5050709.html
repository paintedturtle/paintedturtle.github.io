50 watt variant of Yorkville‚Äôs Acoustic Master series of amplifiers. This unit is in good condition ‚Äî it is clean and it works reliably.

Yorkville designed the AM50 to be the perfect compact combo amplifier for solo perfomers who play acoustic guitar and sing. Its featureset also makes it a practical amplifier for keyboards, drum machines or other instruments that supply a line level output.

The AM50 can sit upright, like typical amplifier, projecting sound forward. Or it can sit back at angle to project sound upwards away from the floor, which is often a pleasing acoustic arrangement, especially in a cramped practice space.

50 watts of output power into an 8 inch driver and a 3¬æ inch LeSon tweeter. Housed in a sealed cabinet constructed from plywood and covered with rugged carpet.

12 inches wide, 17 inches tall, 14 inches deep ‚Äì a very compact and conveniently sized amplifier. Not too heavy ‚Äì only 23 pounds ‚Äì and it even includes thoughtful velcro ties to keep the power cord out of the way when not in use.

Channel 1 accepts a ¬º inch cable from your acoustic-electric guitar or another electric instrument. The Pre-Amp control can accommodate guitars with active and passive pickups. The signal is routed through a two band EQ (low &amp; high) and then a sweepable notch filter to help reduce unwanted feedback.

Channel 2 accepts a ¬º inch TRS cable from any line level instrument and a balanced XLR cable from a microphone. This channel has a single Pre-Amp Gain control.

A very nice sounding spring reverb is applied to both channels with a single control to mix the effect into the output signal.

Both inputs are equipped with clip indicator lights and there is ¬º inch line output on front control panel to route audio to another device.

<a href="mailto:instruments@paintedturtle.xyz">Send us a note</a> if you have any questions, or if you would like to arrange a time to drop by and inspect it. We are located in Little Italy a few blocks from the corner of Preston &amp; Somerset. Usually we are available on weekday afternoons and evenings ‚Äî just let us know what might work best for you and we‚Äôll get back to you shortly.

We have a microphone and an electric piano that you can use to test the amplifier. However, we don‚Äôt have an acoustic-electric guitar on hand so you may want to bring your own if plan on pairing it with this amplifier.
