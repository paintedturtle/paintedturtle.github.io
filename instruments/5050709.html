50 watt variant of Yorkville‚Äôs Acoustic Master series of amplifiers. This one is in very good condition ‚Äî it is clean and it works reliably.

Yorkville designed the AM50 to be the perfect compact combo amplifier for solo performers who play acoustic guitar and sing. Its feature set also makes it a practical amplifier for keyboards, drum machines or other instruments that supply a line level output.

The AM50 can sit upright, like a typical amplifier, projecting sound forward. Or it can sit back at an angle to project sound upwards away from the floor, which is often a pleasing acoustic arrangement, especially in a cramped practice space.

50 watts of output power into an 8 inch driver and a 3¬æ inch LeSon tweeter. Housed in a sealed cabinet constructed from plywood and covered with rugged carpet.

Channel 1 accepts a ¬º inch cable from your acoustic-electric guitar or a similar instrument. The Pre-Amp control can accommodate guitars with active and passive pickups. The signal is routed through a two band EQ (low &amp; high) and then a sweepable notch filter to reduce pesky feedback.

Channel 2 accepts a ¬º inch TRS cable from any line level instrument and a balanced XLR cable from a microphone. This channel has a single Pre-Amp Gain control.

A very nice sounding spring reverb is applied to both channels with a single control to mix the effect into the output signal.

Both inputs are equipped with clip indicator lights and there is ¬º inch line output on front control panel to route audio to another device.

12 inches wide, 17 inches tall, 14 inches deep ‚Äì conveniently sized and not too heavy ‚Äì only 23 pounds. Packs up easily and has a thoughtful velcro loop to keep the power cord out of the way.

<a href="mailto:instruments@paintedturtle.xyz">Send us a message</a> if you have any questions, or to arrange a time to drop by and inspect it.

We have a microphone and an electric piano that you can use to test the amplifier. However, we don‚Äôt have an acoustic-electric guitar on hand so you may want to bring your own if plan on pairing it with this amplifier.
