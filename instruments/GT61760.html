A very reliable and versatile 15 watt guitar amplifier.

It has a good clean channel and four distinct distortion circuits: Overdrive, Distortion, Metal and Metal Stack. Of course there is a gain control so that you can dial in the amount of distortion that you want on each setting.

Three band EQ (bass, middle, treble) that is nicer than most other amps we have found in size.

We used this amplifier for electric guitar, electric piano and synthesizers and it worked great in all scenarios. It has a main input and an auxiliary input so that you can amplify two sources at the same time. The pre-amplifier EQ and distortion settings are only applied to the main input. The auxilary input bypasses the pre-amp and goes straight to the power-amp. We often used it for electric guitar and electric piano simultaneously and it performed marvelously.

Please send us a note if you have any questions or to schedule a time to play it.
