A very reliable and versatile 15 watt guitar amplifier. 

It has a good clean channel and four distinct distortion circuits: Overdrive, Distortion, Metal and Metal Stack. Of course there is a Gain control so that you can dial in the amount of distortion that you want on each setting. 

Three band EQ (bass, middle, treble) that is nicer than most other amps i’ve found in this price range. 

We used this amp for guitar, electric piano and synthesizers and it worked great in all scenarios. It has a main input and an auxiliary input so that you can amplify two sources at the same time. We often used it for guitar and electric piano simultaneously and it performed like a champ. 

Pickup in Little Italy. We have right-handed and left-handed guitars at the house that you can play to test out the amp... or bring your own guitar if that’s convenient for you. 

Please email me through Kijiji if you have any questions. Also interested in trades for musical instruments (trumpet, lefty guitars, small keyboards, microphones, etc).
